## About me
*(This section will be moved towards a different folder soon<sup>TM</sup>)*
I am a former chemistry student with a great interest in data analysis. I (properly) started my coding journey about half a year ago by learning python and working through some ebooks on **data science** and **machine learning**. I intend to update this repository with some of my smaller and larger projects, and whatever else I am working on. Expect to see more here, soon! (They still need some polishing ^^ )
