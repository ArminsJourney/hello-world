# Some Ideas and Rough Outlines of Small and Large Projects
---

## Small Projects

### Stock Prediction Algorithms
Find different mehods to predict stock prices. 
- Simple linear and multivariate regression
- Neural Nets
- ...
Turn it into larger project (true trading bot).

### Case Study "housing price analysis"
Implement knowledge of Regression Models, Decision Trees, Neural Networks and make visually appealing.



## Big Projects

### Trading Bot
More in-depth. Implement data pipeline and continuos predictions based on incoming data. Use reinforcement learning and/or other methods. Long term goal would be to enable possibility of actual automatic trading. 

### Starcraft 2 Bot
Bot that uses compartmentalized "knowledge" (modules) to make game decisions and hopefully beat up to the "harder" AI.
Use Deep Q Learning.

### "Automated" Beer Pong Table
Cameras and image recognition to stream to scoreboard. Replays of the shot, automate visual effects to stream to video channel (twitch for example).
